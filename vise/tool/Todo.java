//	x Handle directory for file based store
// - change error messages for Recorded grips on when no match
// - Put video example in the examples directory
// x deal with package structure
// - expose the objects so that people can write tests against them; labels may help with this
// - Make an assertions() call which returns a string of assertions to place in tests.
//	x Degrade to 1.4.2 for everyone stuck there
//	x consider adding grips with handles again
// x need test to revert to outside section state..throw errors in invalid states
//	- Produce exceptions with proper stack trace for persistence errors
